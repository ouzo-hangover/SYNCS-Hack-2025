## Problem Statement: CITIES OF THE FUTURE

The world is ever-evolving and the cities are becoming more than just places to live. They are centres of culture, innovation, and human connection. But as populations grow and move into urban areas, the challenges of sustainability, efficiency, and optimality grow more urgent.

Climate change, resource scarcity, and the evolving nature of work all raise the same question: What kind of technologies will power the Cities of the Future? How might we design tools and systems that help cities thrive in the face of these challenges?
 
- How can urban infrastructure be reimagined to ensure sustainability in the long term under the ever-present issue of climate change?
- What solutions can optimise public resources, such as water, electricity, and waste management, in expanding cities?
- How can we support diverse industries and workers in a future where remote work and the gig economy are the norm?

## Our Solution: hai
hai, short for "hobbies and interests", a new social platform to enable you to swap learning skills. Whether its a new language, new sport or hobby, you'll find it in hai.

Future cities will be more melded with technology than ever, so in a digital world we want our communities to thrive off connection through similar ideals, passions and interests.

So come on, say hai, learn a new skill and make some new friends along the way.
